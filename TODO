// Open issues
- All data transmission paths within the gateway should be asynchronous
- The queue in GwClient.cpp has to be removed to allow congestion control (PARTLY)
- Doxygen (STARTED)
- Fix all the TODOs in the source code



// DONE
- Added support for the length-based framing mode
- Port the escaping-based framing mode to the framing framework
- The ToolFrame.h file looks very quick and dirty... requires a cleanup (DONE)
- Add a big warning somewhere that the legacy "escaping-based framing" breaks during congestion and should not be used for any future project (DONE)
- Add command line switches and online help ("-h --help") to the gateway (DONE)
