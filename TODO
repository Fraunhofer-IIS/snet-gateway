Issues to be resolved before a first release:
- Doxygen (STARTED)
- Fix all the TODOs in the source code
- Add a big warning somewhere that the "tool protocol" breaks during congestion and should not be used for any future project



Issues to be resolved after the first release:
- The ToolFrame.h file looks very quick and dirty... requires a cleanup
- All data transmission paths within the gateway should be asynchronous
- The queue in ToolHandler.cpp has to be removed to allow congestion control



// DONE
- Add command line switches and online help ("-h --help") to the gateway (DONE)
